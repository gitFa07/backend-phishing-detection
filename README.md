# Phishing URL Detection

A machine-learning project that classifies a submitted URL as **Phishing** or **Legitimate**. It includes a FastAPI backend, a trained Random Forest model, URL feature extraction, and a lightweight browser-based frontend.

> **Important:** This project analyzes URL-level features. It does not currently visit the website or inspect its page content. Treat predictions as indicators, not as a guarantee that a website is safe or malicious.

## Features

- URL classification using a trained Random Forest model.
- Extraction of 14 lexical and structural URL features.
- Phishing and legitimate class-probability values.
- Browser-based interface for submitting URLs and viewing results.
- Feature details shown alongside the prediction.
- FastAPI interactive API documentation.
- A saved SHAP explainer artifact for future explainability work.

## Technology stack

**Backend**

- Python
- FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Pandas and scikit-learn
- Joblib for loading saved model artifacts

**Frontend**

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Browser Fetch API

The current frontend is a static page in `frontend/index.html`; it does **not** require Node.js, npm, React, or a frontend build step.

- `frontend/index.html` — scanner UI and browser-side API requests.
- `src/app.py` — FastAPI application and API endpoints.
- `src/features.py` — extracts features from a submitted URL.
- `src/model.py` — loads the saved classifier and returns predictions.
- `models/phishing_rf_model.joblib` — trained Random Forest model.
- `models/feature_columns.joblib` — expected model feature order.
- `models/shap_explainer.joblib` — saved SHAP artifact; the current API does not return SHAP explanations.

## Prerequisites

Install the following:

- **Git** — to clone the repository.
- **Python 3.12** — recommended for the pinned dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- A modern web browser.

Check your Python installation:

```bash
python --version
```

On Windows, if `python` does not point to the intended version, try:

```powershell
py -3.12 --version
```

The model artifacts are already included in the repository, so you do not need to train the model to run the application.

## 1. Clone the repository

Replace `<YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>` with the HTTPS or SSH URL of your Git repository:

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd backend-phishing-detection-main
```

The directory name after cloning depends on the repository name. If your cloned folder has a different name, `cd` into that folder instead.

If you downloaded the project as a ZIP, extract it and open a terminal in the extracted project root—the directory containing `requirements.txt`, `src/`, `models/`, and `frontend/`.

## 2. Set up and run the backend

Run these commands from the **project root**, where `requirements.txt` is located.

### Create a virtual environment

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, you can use Command Prompt instead:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Python dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If installation fails, confirm that the virtual environment is activated and that you are using Python 3.12. Do not install packages globally just to work around a virtual-environment problem.

### Start the API

From the same project root, run:

```bash
python -m uvicorn src.app:app --reload
```

The API should be available at:

- API base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Health check: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
- Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

Keep this terminal open while using the frontend.

The health check should return:

```json
{
  "message": "Phishing Detection API is running"
}
```

## 3. Run the frontend

Open a **second terminal** in the project root. Do not stop the backend terminal.

Run:

```bash
python -m http.server 5500 --directory frontend
```

Then open:

**http://127.0.0.1:5500**

This serves `frontend/index.html` locally. No `npm install` or frontend build is needed.

If your Python version does not support `--directory`, use:

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

The frontend's API address field defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. If your backend is running at another address, enter that backend base URL in the field at the top of the page.

## 4. Use the application

1. Start the backend and frontend using the instructions above.
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.
3. Confirm that the page reports **API connected**.
4. Enter a full URL, such as `https://example.com/login`, or choose one of the example URLs.
5. Select **Check URL**.
6. Review the classification, probability scores, and extracted URL features.

A “Legitimate” result is not proof that a site is safe. Avoid opening suspicious links just to test them.

## API reference

### `GET /`

Checks whether the backend is running.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### `POST /predict`

Accepts a URL and returns the prediction, class probabilities, and extracted features.

**Request:**

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/login"
}
```

**Example response shape** (values are illustrative):

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/login",
  "prediction": "Legitimate",
  "phishing_probability": 0.12,
  "legitimate_probability": 0.88,
  "features": {
    "url_length": 25,
    "hostname_length": 11,
    "path_length": 6,
    "num_dots": 1,
    "num_hyphens": 0,
    "num_slashes": 3,
    "num_digits": 0,
    "num_special_chars": 5,
    "has_https": 1,
    "has_at_symbol": 0,
    "has_query": 0,
    "has_ip": 0,
    "num_subdomains": 0,
    "has_suspicious_keyword": 1
  }
}
```

The real response values depend on the URL and the trained model. You can also send requests through the interactive Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Troubleshooting

### The frontend says the API is unavailable

- Confirm the backend terminal is still running.
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` directly in your browser.
- Check the API address field in the frontend.
- Check the browser developer tools' Console and Network tabs for errors.

### A CORS error appears

The backend currently enables CORS in `src/app.py`. If you change the frontend origin or deployment setup, update the backend CORS configuration to allow the intended frontend origin. For production, avoid allowing every origin; configure only the origins you control.

### Model files cannot be found

Run Uvicorn from the project root, not from inside `src/`. Verify that these files exist:

```text
models/phishing_rf_model.joblib
models/feature_columns.joblib
```

### Dependency installation fails

- Check `python --version` and use Python 3.12.
- Activate `.venv` before installing dependencies.
- Upgrade pip inside the virtual environment.
- Read the first package error in the installation output; later errors may be consequences of that first failure.

### Port 8000 or 5500 is already in use

Choose a free port. For example, start the API on another port with:

```bash
python -m uvicorn src.app:app --reload --port 8001
```

Then update the frontend API address to `http://127.0.0.1:8001`. To change the frontend port, pass a different port to `python -m http.server`.

## Limitations

- Classification is based on URL-level lexical and structural features; the backend does not fetch the target webpage.
- DNS reputation, certificate information, redirects, and page content are not currently analyzed.
- The SHAP explainer file is included, but SHAP explanations are not currently returned by `/predict`.
- Model probabilities are estimates from the trained classifier, not absolute certainty.
- The current backend does not include authentication, rate limiting, or production-grade monitoring.
- The current CORS configuration is permissive and should be restricted before production deployment.

## Future improvements

- Integrate SHAP explanations into the API response.
- Add stronger URL validation and automated tests.
- Add domain-reputation, DNS, certificate, or webpage-content signals.
- Restrict CORS and add rate limiting, logging, and monitoring.
- Add deployment instructions for a hosted frontend and backend.
